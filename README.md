# MoveDetect
Bachelor project: Real-time Voluntary Movement Detection using EEG signals

The model receives EEG signals as input and outputs a classification of whether a movement happened.
MoveDetect consists of three core functionalities: pre-processing, feature extracting, and classifying. MoveDetect is written in the Python programming language, making use of the MNE library for signal pre-processing and feature extraction and TensorFlow and scikit-learn for constructing the architecture of the classifier.
